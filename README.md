# Future_ML_01
# SALES FORECASTING FOR RETAIL BUSINESS📊📈

Welcome to FUTURE_ML_01, a project that explores the power of machine learning in predicting and analyzing future events or behaviors based on historical data and engineered features. This notebook serves as a foundational exploration of predictive modeling using core ML techniques like Linear Regression, Data Preprocessing, and Visualization.<br>

### 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates:
* Loading and exploring a CSV dataset
* Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
* Visualizing data distributions and correlations
* Building and training a linear regression model
* Making predictions and evaluating model performance


### 🧾 About the Dataset

This project uses a sample sales dataset named `sales_data_sample.csv`, which contains records of customer orders from a fictional retail company. Each row represents a product purchase and includes:

- **Customer details**: name, country, contact info  
- **Product details**: product code, product line, quantity ordered, price  
- **Order info**: order number, order date, status, deal size  

This dataset is suitable for regression-based predictions (like sales forecasting) and business analytics tasks such as:
- Predicting revenue
- Analyzing product performance
- Understanding geographical sales distribution
  
### 🔧 Technologies Used
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
